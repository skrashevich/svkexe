// provider, so its PatchTool drives the FileDiff renderer with the same shared
// singleton directly (see vue/composables/fileDiffInstance.ts). Keeping the
// pool/highlighter options here means both worlds preload the exact same set
// of languages and run tokenization off the main thread.

// extensions (lua, perl, dockerfile, vue, svelte, …) don't need to bloat every
// worker's startup. Carried over verbatim from the original React App.tsx
